## Tools

The following tools were instrumental in simplifying the development process for the chat app:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Backend service used for real-time data synchronization, user authentication, and database management.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library utilized for building the user interface and managing component-based architecture.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Feature-rich source code editor with extensive support for React development, including syntax highlighting, debugging, and integrated terminal.
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/): Preprocessor scripting language that helps streamline the styling process by allowing the use of variables, nesting, and other advanced features.

These tools, combined with the capabilities of Firebase for backend management, React for front-end development, Visual Studio Code for code editing, and SCSS for styling, significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of the chat app development process.
